README: Word Guessing Game

# Description
This program is a simple console-based word guessing game. Users try to guess a randomly selected word by inputting letters. They have 10 attempts to guess the word correctly.

# Features
Random Word Selection: Each game session randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words, such as 'apple', 'soccer', and 'creative'.

Guess Feedback: The game provides immediate feedback on whether a guessed letter is part of the word, and displays the current state of the guessed word, with underscores replacing unguessed letters.

Attempt Tracking: Players are limited to 10 guesses, and the game tracks and displays the number of remaining attempts after each guess.

Input Validation: The game checks for invalid inputs (non-alphabetical characters, multiple characters, or previously guessed letters) and prompts the player to enter a valid single alphabetical letter.

# How to Run the Game
Follow the on-screen instructions:
The game will start and display a series of underscores representing the letters of the word to be guessed.

You will be prompted to enter a letter. Type a letter and press Enter.
The game will update the display based on your input, showing any correctly guessed letters in their correct positions.

If the guess is incorrect, the number of remaining tries will decrease.
Continue guessing letters until:
You guess the word correctly, or
You run out of tries.

# Ending Game
The game concludes either when you guess the word correctly, or you exhaust your 10 tries.

Upon completion, the game will display the correct word if you didn't guess it.
